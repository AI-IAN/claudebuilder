```

## Complexity Control Techniques

### 1. Explicit Constraints
Always specify what NOT to include:

```bash
# Good: Very specific constraints
"Build a simple calculator (complexity: minimal):
INCLUDE ONLY:
- Basic math operations (+, -, *, /)
- Clean HTML interface
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Basic CSS styling

DO NOT INCLUDE:
- Advanced math functions
- User accounts
- Data persistence
- Frameworks
- Deployment setup"

# Bad: Too vague (Claude will add enterprise features)
"Build a calculator app"
```

### 2. Time Boxing
Set strict time limits:

```bash
"Build a todo app that can be completed in exactly 2 hours:
- Focus on core functionality only
- Use simplest possible tech stack
- Skip any advanced features
- Make it functional, not perfect"
```

### 3. Progressive Enhancement
Build incrementally:

```bash
# Phase 1: Minimal
"Build minimal version of inventory tracker with just add/remove items"

# Phase 2: Add one feature
"Add search functionality to existing inventory tracker, nothing else"

# Phase 3: Add another feature  
"Add user authentication to inventory tracker, keep everything else simple"
```

### 4. Feature Blocking
Explicitly prevent scope creep:

```bash
"Build a simple chat app. 
STOP and ask permission before adding:
- File sharing
- User profiles
- Message encryption
- Push notifications
- Any other features not explicitly requested"
```

## GitHub Integration for Complexity Control

### Issue Labels
Use GitHub labels to enforce complexity:

```bash
# Automatic labeling
complexity:minimal     # Green label, 1-3 hours
complexity:standard    # Yellow label, 1-3 days  
complexity:enterprise  # Red label, 1-2 weeks

# Feature scope labels
scope:core            # Essential functionality
scope:enhancement     # Nice-to-have features
scope:future          # Future considerations
```

### Issue Templates
Create complexity-specific templates:

```markdown
# Minimal Project Template
**Estimated Time**: 1-3 hours
**Technology Stack**: Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS
**Features**: Core functionality only
**Deployment**: Local development

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Core user flow works
- [ ] Basic error handling
- [ ] Simple, clean interface
- [ ] Completed within time limit

## Constraints
- NO frameworks or libraries
- NO database integration
- NO user authentication
- NO deployment automation
```

### Automated Complexity Checking
Use GitHub Actions to enforce complexity:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/complexity-check.yml
name: Complexity Check
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  check-complexity:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check for complexity violations
        run: |
          # Check for enterprise patterns in minimal projects
          # Fail if complexity limits exceeded
```

## Common Complexity Violations

### Minimal Projects Going Standard
‚ùå **Problem**: Adding authentication to minimal project  
‚úÖ **Solution**: "Keep current minimal version, create new standard version if auth needed"

‚ùå **Problem**: Adding database to simple file-based app  
‚úÖ **Solution**: "Stick to JSON files, upgrade to standard complexity if database needed"

### Standard Projects Going Enterprise
‚ùå **Problem**: Adding microservices to single-app project  
‚úÖ **Solution**: "Keep monolith architecture, plan enterprise version separately if needed"

‚ùå **Problem**: Adding Kubernetes to simple Docker app  
‚úÖ **Solution**: "Use simple Docker deployment, upgrade to enterprise if scaling needed"

### Scope Creep Prevention
‚ùå **Problem**: "While we're at it, let's add..."  
‚úÖ **Solution**: "Create separate issue for additional features"

‚ùå **Problem**: Adding features not in original requirements  
‚úÖ **Solution**: "Complete current scope first, then discuss additions"

- [ ] Time box established and agreed upon
- [ ] Technology stack constraints documented
- [ ] Feature scope clearly defined
- [ ] "Do not include" list created
- [ ] Success criteria established

### During Development
- [ ] Staying within complexity boundaries
- [ ] Time box being respected
- [ ] No scope creep occurring
- [ ] Technology choices appropriate for complexity
- [ ] Regular progress against timeline

### Before Completion
- [ ] All requirements met within complexity level
- [ ] No unauthorized features added
- [ ] Time box respected
- [ ] Quality appropriate for complexity level
- [ ] Documentation matches complexity requirements

## Success Metrics

### Minimal Projects
- ‚úÖ Completed within 1-3 hours
- ‚úÖ Core functionality working
- ‚úÖ No unauthorized complexity added
- ‚úÖ Clean, simple implementation

### Standard Projects  
- ‚úÖ Completed within 1-3 days
- ‚úÖ Production-ready quality
- ‚úÖ Proper testing implemented
- ‚úÖ Security measures appropriate
- ‚úÖ Documentation complete

### Enterprise Projects

Remember: The goal is predictable, controlled development. When in doubt, start with lower complexity and upgrade incrementally rather than over-engineering from the start.
